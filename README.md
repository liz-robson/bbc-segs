## Blackjack Tech Test 

1) I have used the starter code to write files that satisfy the scenarios, and they have also been tested using the test file. I have also extended the blackjack.py/play file to create a basic running program that showcases that all the scenarios work.

2) I have also extended the game further in a separate file (extended_play_blackjack) to include further game play/interactivity and the player playing against a dealer.
I didn't have chance to create Classes and set up in OOP for this additional play, so have not been included in the blackjack.py file and it runs as a separate game. 

The extended play of Blackjack (also satisfies criteria and scenarios of the assessment)

 - Includes interaction with player and invites input
 - Displays player cards and dealers opening card
 - Player vs Dealer game play
 - Decides a winner
 - Resetting the deck for a new game
