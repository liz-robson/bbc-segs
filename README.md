## Blackjack Tech Test 

I have used the starter code to write files that satisfy the scenarios, and they have also been tested using the test file.

I have also extended the play file to create a basic running program that showcases that all the scenarios work.

I have also extended the game further in a separate file to include further game play/interactivity and the player playing against a dealer - see other folder.
I didn't have chance to create Classes and set up in OOP for this additional play, so have not been included in the starter files.
